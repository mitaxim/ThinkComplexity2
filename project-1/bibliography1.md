Experimental observation of chimeras in coupled map lattices

Hagerstrom A M et. al., Nature Physics 2012, DOI:10.1038NPHY2372

The authors report experimental realisation of chimera states, 
states with co-existing coherent and incoherent clusters of oscillators
on a nonlinearly coupled lattice with discrete dynamics. The lattice was craeted
by using a liquid crystal, spatial light modulator.The device allows parallel 
simulation of coupled map arrays, using variety of different
couplings. 

Stochastic resonance in neuronal network from mammalian brain
Gluckman B J et. al., Physical Review Letters vol. 77(19) (1996)

 A neural network of mammalian brain was delivered noise and periodic signal
using electrical field and the brain activity was measured. Resonance was 
observed in the response of the brain with with increase in the amplitude of
the stochastic component in presence of a weak periodic signal.

Ordering, metastability and phase-transitions in two dimensional systems
Kosterlitz J M and Thouless D. J., J. Phys. C. vol.6 (1973) 1182

A new definition of long range order is given for two dimensional solids.
It is shown that the definition is useful in understanding, system response
to external perturbation with change in a parameter. The theory is used to
understand existence or non-existence of phase-transition in different physical
systems.
